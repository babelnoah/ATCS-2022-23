                    and then some. James is clutch, he can score at a ridiculous level despite that not being his best
                    attribute,
                    rebounds well and is a fantastic playmaker, his most impressive trait. Few players have ever matched

                    normal for NBA superstars and being part of a star-studded team – but there’s no questioning his
                    status as an all-time great,
                    as the legendary swingman filled the stat sheet and possessed a terrific all-around game, as a

                    ball-handling, quickness and a pristine jumper that he can hit from legitimately anywhere on the
                    floor. Durant’s also an impactful
                    defender when he needs to be, moving his feet quickly and blocking shots at pivotal moments. Durant
                    may still move up in the ranking, but will not be in contention for the top spot due to missed time
                    because of injury.</h4>

                    higher in the statistical categories had he spent his whole career in the Association. Erving was
                    the most spectacular
                    player to date at the time thanks to his unreal athleticism and ability to fly down the floor in
                    transition to hammer in dunks… and he was a winner, too. Often considered Jordan before Jordan (just
                    without a jumper),
