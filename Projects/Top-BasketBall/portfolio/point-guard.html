                    All-Stars</h4>
                <h4>The leader of one of the finest teams in basketball history, Magic Johnson had flash, pizzazz and
                    any adjective you can think of as a playmaker, often hightailing it down the open floor and making
                    spectacular passes that not many others would have attempted, let alone pulled off as successfully
                    as he did. Magic was also a winner, making iconic plays over and over again in the biggest of
                    stages. Add in his super charismatic personality and you have the complete package as one of the
                    biggest superstars the league has ever seen.</h4>

                <h4>The first player to average a triple-double in league history, Oscar Robertson was an expert
                    playmaker, rebounder and scorer at the lead guard spot, and a somewhat underrated player
                    historically. He experienced very little team success until he joined forces with Lew Alcindor in
                    Milwaukee, but did eventually win an NBA championship. One of the most well-rounded offensive guards
                    ever.</h4>

                <h4>Stephen Curry changed the way the game is played, as now, basically every player on the floor wants
                    to shoot threes, and needs to be able to hit them for your offense to keep up with modern scoring.
                    Curry’s a wizard not only as a shooter, but his playmaking deserves more credit than it receives.
                    The future Hall-of-Famer out of Davidson is already the greatest shooter ever – and it’s not
                    particularly close.</h4>

                    All-Defensive 1st Team selections</h4>
                <h4>No one on this Earth can possibly hate the Celtics as much as Jerry West, having lost to them in the
                    Finals six times out of the six he faced them. Impossible to blame West for those championship
                    defeats, though, as he put up beastly numbers against them on a consistent basis – just as he did
                    against the rest of the NBA. West was a masterful combo guard who performed at a high level thanks
                    to his scoring and playmaking. He was also a great shooter, both off the dribble and with his feet
                    set. He made the All-Star each of his seasons in the league, which only four other players with
                    10-plus seasons of NBA experience have accomplished.</h4>

                <h4>Perhaps the best player ever under 6-foot-1, Isiah Thomas combined talent with fierce
                    competitiveness. He could create at an elite level but could also score out of the midrange off the
                    dribble. He was the face of the Bad Boys Pistons who beat Jordan’s Bulls three straight times in the
                    playoffs in the late ’80s. The one thing holding Thomas back on this list is he had a short career
                    for star standards.</h4>
