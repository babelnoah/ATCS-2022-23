                <h2>1) Tim Duncan</h2>
                <h4>Accolades: Five NBA titles, three Finals MVPs, two MVPs, 10 All-NBA 1st Team selections, eight
                    All-Defensive 1st Team selections</h4>
                <h4>The rare low-maintenance superstar, Tim Duncan was impactful and successful team-wise from the
                    get-go through the end of his career.
                    Duncan anchored the winningest team of the century and did so in a low-key manner, without enough
                    acclaim for his greatness or accomplishments.
                    Don’t believe us? How about the fact that he never won Defensive Player of the Year despite being
                    selected to eight 1st Team All-Defenses,
                    making that slight a major travesty, one that shows how underrated he was even in his prime.
                    There’s even a chance Duncan would be ranked higher in many GOAT lists with a more entertaining
                    off-court persona, but either way, he’s the greatest power forward ever.</h4>

                <h2>2) Karl Malone</h2>
                <h4>Accolades: Two MVPs, 11 All-NBA 1st Team selections, 14 All-Stars, three All-Defensive 1st Team
                    selections</h4>
                <h4>A model of consistency through the years, Karl Malone had a 17-year stretch, just discounting his
                    first and last seasons,
                    where he averaged at least 20 points per game. In that span, he put up 26.0 points and 10.3 rebounds
                    per contest,
                    numbers that most players would love to average for one season, let alone 17.
                    Malone did have some shortcomings in the playoffs, however, at least compared to fellow megastars,
                    and that put him a little lower
                    on the totem pole than he could have been with a ring or two on his resume.</h4>

                <h2>3) Kevin Garnett</h2>
                <h4>Accolades: One NBA title, one MVP, nine All-NBA Teams, 15 All-Stars, one Defensive Player of the
                    Year award, nine All-Defensive 1st Team selections</h4>
                <h4>One of the first unicorns in the NBA, Kevin Garnett had the size of the center and all-around skills
                    of a guard, even bringing the ball down before big men
                    were really allowed to do that. Garnett took a run-of-the-mill Wolves teams to the playoffs
                    consistently while scoring, rebounding, distributing and defending
                    at an elite level. One could even argue he sacrificed offensive numbers to put all-out effort on
                    defense. Fun fact (except if you’re a Wolves fan):
                    Minnesota made the playoffs in eight of 14 Garnett seasons and only once in the 18 years without
                    him. That’s the kind of impact he had. His championship ring
                    with the Celtics came late, but it was beyond deserved.</h4>

                <h2>4) Dirk Nowitzki</h2>
                <h4>Accolades: One NBA title, one Finals MVP, one MVP, 12 All-NBA selections, 14 All-Stars</h4>
                <h4>The first European player on the list, Dirk Nowitzki was another revolutionary player thanks to his
                    three-point and off-the-dribble prowess in a 7-foot-tall body.
                    Nowitzki’s elite skill level made the common thinking go from being that big men need to stay in the
                    paint to: If your big men don’t space the floor,
                    you’re at a disadvantage. Nowitzki made a contender, and eventually a champion, out of the Mavericks
                    without star sidekicks for the most part of his career,
                    hoisting the trophy in 2011 and winning Finals MVP for his efforts.</h4>

                <h2>5) Giannes Antetokounmpo</h2>
                <h4>Accolades: One NBA title, one Finals MVP, two MVPs, four All-NBA 1st Team selections, six All-Stars,
                    one Defensive Player of the Year award, four All-Defensive 1st Team selections</h4>
                <h4>A rags to riches story if there ever was one, Giannis Antetokounmpo went from playing in a
                    semi-professional league to being a 15th-overall pick in the draft to winning multiple league
                    MVP awards in just a few years. Antetokounmpo is a player who will likely finish higher on this
                    list. The Greek forward boasts freakish length and athleticism plus massive work ethic and motor,
                    which help him absolutely dominate despite lacking an outside jumper.
