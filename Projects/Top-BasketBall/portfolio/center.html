                    five All-Defensive 1st Team selections</h4>
                <h4>The GOAT debate is considered a two-horse race at this point in the NBA, but if there is a strong
                    third candidate,
                    it’s Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who dominated for almost two decades thanks to his skyhook shot and
                    overall greatness as a scorer,
                    rebounder and shot-blocker. If anything, the longevity argument is still with Abdul-Jabbar, as the
                    all-time big man won his two
                    Finals MVP awards 14 years apart, first in 1971 and then again in 1985. Most players’ careers don’t
                    last anywhere near that long,
                    yet Abdul-Jabbar was dominating at the highest level for that long.</h4>

                <h4>Bill Russell’s record for most NBA titles will never be beaten, as no one has come, or will come
                    close to his 11 career championships.
                    Russell’s resume is actually hurt because many accolades, like Finals MVP or Defensive Player of the
                    Years didn’t even exist in his heyday.
                    What’s more, since blocks weren’t recorded as a stat in his career, there’s no way to know how many
                    Russell had for his career. There’s a chance
                    he would be at the top of blocks standings along with the player coming up next on our ranking.
                    Russell may not have had the longest career, but boy,
                    was that run successful. Just as a curious note: Russell had more MVPs than All-NBA 1st Team
                    selections in his career (three).</h4>

                    All-Stars, two All-Defensive 1st Team selections</h4>
                <h4>The most dominant big man offensively in NBA history, though that partially had to do with the level
                    of competition
                    Wilt Chamberlain faced in his era. Still, when you dominate at the level Chamberlain did, who cares
                    who he did it against?
                    Chamberlain’s single-season rebounding and scoring records are unassailable. Plus he has the
                    second-best scoring average behind only Jordan.
                    And had MJ played one more year with the Wizards, Chamberlain might actually be No. 1 in that stat.
                    Chamberlain is also the only guy to lead the league in total scoring, rebounds and assists for a
                    season, and retired as the all-time leader
                    in scoring and rebounding at the time.</h4>

                <h4>The most dominant physical specimen in the NBA since the days of Chamberlain, Shaquille O’Neal was
                    an absolute freak with his blend of size,
                    strength and unreal explosiveness. During O’Neal’s peak years, teams were making moves with the sole
                    intention of containing the big man.
                    Many ho-hum centers made a killing thanks to that just because they were another huge body to throw
                    at O’Neal.</h4>

                <h4>The best international player ever, Hakeem Olajuwon competed and produced at an elite level on both
                    ends of the floor with outstanding low-post moves
                    and defensive skills to match. Olajuwon ranks first in blocks on record, though there’s a bit of an
                    asterisk on that because they didn’t keep track of
                    those before 1973-74. Also, he is the only player to rank Top 14 in four different major statistical
                    categories: points, rebounds, blocks and steals.</h4>
